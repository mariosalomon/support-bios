Originally from Poland, lived in Greece and London for a while and travelled quite a bit mainly in SE Asia and Europe before moving to the beautiful coast of Cornwall, UK. I live in a countryside with my partner James, a dog called Betty and 2 pet rats - Pickle and Pepper. I absolutely love animals and weâre looking to hopefully rescue a new family member soon. In my spare time I love being on the beach- either surfing or taking long walks and pictures. You can also quite often find me glued to my Kindle or cooking. My goal in the near future is to buy a van move the family to the South of Europe for a while before settling in somewhere long term and rescuing even more furry kids.</p>

After graduating from Northeastern University in 2009 with a B.A. in International Affairs/Cultural Anthropology, I moved to Denver, Colorado, mostly on a whim, with only two suitcases. There, I began my journey in the tech industry when I started working for Apple in 2011. In 2013, I transferred to Portland, Oregon and continued my journey with Apple.<br /><br />I joined Squarespace during my time in Portland, and it was there that I first gained exposure to the world of remote work. When I decided to move back to the East Coast, I knew I wanted to work in a design-centric, remote work environment, which is how I ended up joining InVision in April 2018.<br /><br />I currently reside in Gloucester, Massachusetts. When not working, I love taking photos, being outside (mostly hiking and beaching), listening to tons of podcasts, reading (mostly nonfiction), yoga, dabbling in graphic design, and getting way too invested in TV shows. Iâm a dog person, and hope to adopt one sometime in the next couple of years. If you have any helpful tips about dog ownership, send âem my way.</p>

    <p class="biography">My name is Patrick (or Pat whichever one you prefer because I have no preference). I was born and raised 30 minutes outside of Baltimore, Maryland. I attended college at Penn State where I graduated in 2011 with a Bachelor of Science in Supply Chain Management &amp; Information Systems (a fancy specification/focus for a business degree). I took my first job out of college at a small consulting firm in upstate New York (Glens Falls) where I learned the art of writing proposals, specifically focusing on spend management. I then interviewed and took a job with Facebook in Austin, Texas in 2012, which was my very first introduction to the world of Tech, where I worked on the Ads billing team. I essentially went from wearing a suit and tie everyday in the cold Northern tundra, to the hot and humid foreign land of Texas I now call home, immersed in the booming Tech scene of Austin. After my time at Facebook, I took a job with Indeed, the job search engine. This was my next step in learning the product side of things by working as an intermediary between customer support and their product teams. After over three years in that role, that is when I came across this amazing company InVision, and I cannot be more thrilled that my journey has led me here! I feel very lucky to have the opportunity to work with so many smart and capable professionals who challenge and teach me so much everyday!<br /><br />When it comes down to it, I am just an East coast guy making my way in the big state of Texas with my family and 4 year old Beagle. I spend my weekends camping in my RV or getting outside and exploring Austin.</p>

    <p class="biography">Hey there! Iâm Daniel â a Portlander who loves photography and traveling. I was born in Chernivtsi, a small and beauitful city in Ukraine. Iâm about 25% Romanian, Ukrainian, German, and Jewish. We moved to Portland in 97 and have lived in the surrounding area ever since. I speak Romanian, Russian, and English (I hope that one is obvious).<br /><br />Growing up, I was fascinated with exploring new places and capturing my experiences. Being the youngest of 7 kids raised by a single mom, I was taught to cherish moments over possessions (read: we were poor). My joy came from the memories I made with friends and the interesting places we could find riding our bikes around. After saving some money from babysitting my nephews one summer, I quickly spent it on a camera that I used to capture everything. In school, I was the guy walking around with a camera while everyone else walked around texting bae on their flip phones. Photography was my enabler â my escape into a world of beauty and depth. It was, and it continues to be my motivation to see the world.<br /><br />I love remote places. Far away from cities with wild climates such as Iceland or the fjords of Norway. I hope to one day visit the Faroe Islands, Lofoten Islands, and Antartica. As much as I love traveling, the Pacific Northwest will always be my home. If Iâm not passing time in a coffee shop, then youâll likely find me on a hike, at the coast, or on the mountain!<br /><br />Oh, and I really love llamas.</p>

I also manage the planning and scheduling of our Private Cloud migrations.<br /><br />I've worked at InVision for about 2 and a half years now. When I was initially hired into Tier 2, there were only 3 of us on the Tier 2 team and just 86 employees in the entire company. One of the coolest parts about working for a company like InVision that has seen such tremendous growth is how well our Support team has adapted over time to the changing needs of our customers; we truly are a well-oiled machine!<br /><br />I live in a small town outside Madison that is nicknamed "Troll Capital of the World" due to the many (and slightly creepy) troll statues that adorn the local businesses. In my spare time, I have a pretty eclectic mix of interests. I love baking, gaming, running/swimming, and playing with my pug puppy Frankie. You might also find me in my music studio practicing violin; one of my dreams is to return to playing within a concert orchestra -- on the side, of course!</p>

Honolulu, Hawaii; various points in Arizona, Oregon and North Carolina; and Marin County, California all served as home bases before he found his way back to his native Texas. Heâs been there ever since, hookinâ âem in the Data Administration, Web Development and SaaS industries since Pentium processors were the hot new thing. He still loves travel and has visited most of the major cities in the US. International highlights include Tulum, Mexico; a big driving trip all over Nicaragua and lazy days on the beaches of the French Riviera and Barcelona. He returns to the left coast of North America every couple of years to enjoy Vancouver, British Columbia; north county San Diego and Orange County, California; Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon, usually car touring many points in between.<br /><br />He lives with his best friend, partner and much better half of 22 years and their three kooky cats. He enjoys writing, reading, photography and film. When itâs over 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18 Celsius) heâll mosey out for a hike, go for a leisurely mountain bike ride on some single track trails, or scurry up a few boulders and short cliffs along a creek bed. He loves primitive camping in hot weather as well, taking big siestas at peak heat and exploring the outdoors when the sun won't kill you. Cooking and eating Texan, Chilean, Mexican, Thai and Indian foods keep him fat and sassy.<br />Eric dreams of running his own animal rescue sanctuary on a big olâ stretch of Texas Hill Country, providing a safe haven and recovery spot for injured wildlife, as well as a home for abandoned and abused domestic, farm and exotic animals. Heâs volunteered and worked with several organizations to this end, including the Austin Zoo, Austin Wildlife Rescue, and the Austin Humane Society.<br /><br />He writes inconsequential sci-fi and horror books and scripts. An avid student of the genres, his partner in crime and he hope to shoot digital films run-and-gun style at various locations on the fly. He doesn't seek financial compensation for his creative work, but merely likes sharing it in digital format with all who might like a look.</p>

During my time at Metropia as Director of Product Ops, I led an undersized team to consistently outperform KPIs and played a critical role in scaling the startup from $500K valuation and 3 employees to a B round pre-money valuation of $30M and 30 employees.<br /><br /></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">On my free time, I enjoy learning and implementing new things, in particular software related technologies. My latest project was using Kafka to create a data pipeline for tweets that used some variation of the word âKevin Durantâ. I also enjoy watching films and I try to watch one or two a week. Lastly, I vaguely attempt to stay in shape by occasionally running or playing soccer. Which reminds me I am a born and raised Madridista (Hala Madrid!)</span></p>
