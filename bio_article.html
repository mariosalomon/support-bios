            I’m Monika! I come from customer support/software quality
            assurance background and hold a BSc in Psychology and Social
            Science. Originally from Poland, lived in Greece and London
            for a while and travelled quite a bit mainly in SE Asia and
            Europe before moving to the beautiful coast of Cornwall,
            UK. I live in a countryside with my partner James, a dog
            called Betty and 2 pet rats - Pickle and Pepper. I absolutely
            love animals and we’re looking to hopefully rescue a new
            family member soon. In my spare time I love being on the
            beach- either surfing or taking long walks and pictures.
            You can also quite often find me glued to my Kindle or cooking.
            My goal in the near future is to buy a van move the family
            to the South of Europe for a while before settling in somewhere
            long term and rescuing even more furry kids.

            Hey, I’m Julia. After graduating from Northeastern University
            in 2009 with a B.A. in International Affairs/Cultural Anthropology,
            I moved to Denver, Colorado, mostly on a whim, with only
            two suitcases. There, I began my journey in the tech industry
            when I started working for Apple in 2011. In 2013, I transferred
            to Portland, Oregon and continued my journey with Apple.<br>
            <br>
            I joined Squarespace during my time in Portland, and it was
            there that I first gained exposure to the world of remote
            work. When I decided to move back to the East Coast, I knew
            I wanted to work in a design-centric, remote work environment,
            which is how I ended up joining InVision in April 2018.<br>
            <br>
            I currently reside in Gloucester, Massachusetts. When not
            working, I love taking photos, being outside (mostly hiking
            and beaching), listening to tons of podcasts, reading (mostly
            nonfiction), yoga, dabbling in graphic design, and getting
            way too invested in TV shows. I’m a dog person, and hope
            to adopt one sometime in the next couple of years. If you
            have any helpful tips about dog ownership, send ‘em my way.

            Jeremy was born and raised in rural Indiana. While earning
            a BA in Creative Writing, he met his wife, played musical
            saw in some bands, and did a fair number of poetry readings.
            While earning his MFA in Creative Writing, he started what
            would be a 7-year career in ed tech, beginning in support
            and ending as manager of an e-learning team at the University
            of Illinois. Then he had an epiphany: the most fun, exciting
            parts of his career were his accomplishments in web design
            and development. So, in November 2018 he went from longtime
            InVision fan to joining its Support team, helping people
            and immersing himself in design. He spends his free time
            walking his pug, reading, writing, and trying to convince
            his wife he’s funny.

            Michael was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia where he
            spent his first 27 years. After graduating high school, Michael
            decided to go to a small Tech college near home while enjoying
            playing music with a few bands. After a couple offers to
            travel playing music, he was approached with an opportunity
            to go on tour with Justin Bieber, so he put college on hold.
            After signing NDAs, someone decided at the last minute to
            hire musicians from Nashville instead. (Looking back, Michael
            is happy about this decision) Michael traveled playing music
            for a while, and decided to not finish college, and rather
            jump into a career at MailChimp. He and his wife recently
            relocated to Portland, Oregon for an adventure, and while
            not as busy with music, he loves exploring the pacific northwest.

            Raynor currently lives in Melbourne, Australia, but only
            because he hasn’t found the right wardrobe to get to Narnia,

            willfully seeking a tornado seems a bit risky and ill-advised.<br>

            Having studied theater at college, Raynor has worked behind
            the scenes as wardrobe assistant, stage manager, costume

            drug addict’, ‘drunk Scottish navy officer’ and ‘dead body’.
            Shockingly, this did not lead to being the next big Australian
            export to rival the likes of Hugh Jackman or Cate Blanchett,
            and instead he has worked as a public servant, crochet workshop

          Eric was born on the Fort Sam Houston Army base outside of San
          Antonio, Texas. At three months old his world tour began with
          Stuttgart Army Airfield, Germany. Honolulu, Hawaii; various points
          in Arizona, Oregon and North Carolina; and Marin County, California
          all served as home bases before he found his way back to his
          native Texas. He’s been there ever since, hookin’ ‘em in the
          Data Administration, Web Development and SaaS industries since
          Pentium processors were the hot new thing. He still loves travel
          and has visited most of the major cities in the US. International
          highlights include Tulum, Mexico; a big driving trip all over
          Nicaragua and lazy days on the beaches of the French Riviera
          and Barcelona. He returns to the left coast of North America
          every couple of years to enjoy Vancouver, British Columbia; north
          county San Diego and Orange County, California; Seattle, Washington
          and Portland, Oregon, usually car touring many points in between.<br>
          <br>
          He lives with his best friend, partner and much better half of
          22 years and their three kooky cats. He enjoys writing, reading,
          photography and film. When it’s over 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18
          Celsius) he’ll mosey out for a hike, go for a leisurely mountain
          bike ride on some single track trails, or scurry up a few boulders
          and short cliffs along a creek bed. He loves primitive camping
          in hot weather as well, taking big siestas at peak heat and exploring
          the outdoors when the sun won't kill you. Cooking and eating
          Texan, Chilean, Mexican, Thai and Indian foods keep him fat and
          sassy.<br>
          Eric dreams of running his own animal rescue sanctuary on a big
          ol’ stretch of Texas Hill Country, providing a safe haven and
          recovery spot for injured wildlife, as well as a home for abandoned
          and abused domestic, farm and exotic animals. He’s volunteered
          and worked with several organizations to this end, including
          the Austin Zoo, Austin Wildlife Rescue, and the Austin Humane
          Society.<br>
          <br>
          He writes inconsequential sci-fi and horror books and scripts.
          An avid student of the genres, his partner in crime and he hope
          to shoot digital films run-and-gun style at various locations
          on the fly. He doesn't seek financial compensation for his creative
          work, but merely likes sharing it in digital format with all
          who might like a look.

        When I’m not managing Tier 2 Support, I moonlight as a professional

        (Cole), and husband (Jay) on the northern coast of California. I
        find my bliss in tea, watching my chickens, running, yoga, and my
        latest endeavor: trying not to fall off of my paddleboard . I have
        a terrible weakness for nachos, true crime shows, and fundraising
        events (random, but it’s become my guilty pleasure over the last
        several years). Before landing at InVision, I did a few other stints
        as a Quality Assurance Engineer on a UI/UX Design Team at the University
        of California, a Business Analyst, an eLearning Developer, and a
        teacher. Having read every Nancy Drew novel possible as a child,
        I fancy myself a detective, and get a thrill out of tracking down
        mystery bugs, and discovering creative workarounds.

          get to surround yourself with all these smart people that inspire
          you and teach you new things on a daily basis. The Support Team
          here feels like a large family and I am very proud to be part
          of it. I grew up in Austria where I spent most of my life living
          in this perfect city called Vienna. Afterwards I moved to London
          for some years and now I am in Dublin. I studied Economics &amp;
          Information Systems as my undergrad and did my Masters in Management
          of Information Systems. At the same time I’ve been working in
          tech companies/startups for several years now. In my spare time
          you’ll always find me travelling, going to the movies, watching
          too many silly tv shows on Netflix, enjoying food way more than
          I should, trying to read more and trying to exercise more. Please
          feel free to reach out to me anytime with questions, comments,
          feedback or simply to just say “Hello” and connect.

          I have worked in support for nearly 30 years with a career ranging
          from mainframes, to desktop (I remember when Windows 3.11 for
          Workgroups was released for example), network management to software
          specific support. I have worked for companies that handle Service
          Desk software, Security software, and money counting software,
          so a degree of diversity! That means I have been exposed to many
          different technologies from OS/400, to Windows 10, Linux, SQL
          Server, ADFS, Weblogic and WebSphere as well as web tech including
          XML, Restful API and JavaScript.<br>
          <br>
          I like history, particularly, but not exclusively, of the UK,
          and reading (Lord of the Rings is still my favourite book), as
          well as walking, when I get the chance to walk among the lakes

          I was born and raised in the D.C. metro area. I currently live

          and did a bunch of different things during that time. I love

          hiking, martial arts, kayaking, oceans, forests, deserts, cities,

            This is Khoa here. I’m a Support Engineer at InVision in
            Dallas, TX. I love everything when it comes to pop culture,
            music, art, and fashion. I enjoy curating playlists through
            the year and sharing them with everyone. Kanye West is my
            spirit animal. And burritos are my favorite food.

            My name is Patrick (or Pat whichever one you prefer because
            I have no preference). I was born and raised 30 minutes outside
            of Baltimore, Maryland. I attended college at Penn State
            where I graduated in 2011 with a Bachelor of Science in Supply
            Chain Management &amp; Information Systems (a fancy specification/focus
            for a business degree). I took my first job out of college
            at a small consulting firm in upstate New York (Glens Falls)
            where I learned the art of writing proposals, specifically
            focusing on spend management. I then interviewed and took
            a job with Facebook in Austin, Texas in 2012, which was my
            very first introduction to the world of Tech, where I worked
            on the Ads billing team. I essentially went from wearing
            a suit and tie everyday in the cold Northern tundra, to the
            hot and humid foreign land of Texas I now call home, immersed
            in the booming Tech scene of Austin. After my time at Facebook,
            I took a job with Indeed, the job search engine. This was
            my next step in learning the product side of things by working
            as an intermediary between customer support and their product
            teams. After over three years in that role, that is when
            I came across this amazing company InVision, and I cannot
            be more thrilled that my journey has led me here! I feel
            very lucky to have the opportunity to work with so many smart
            and capable professionals who challenge and teach me so much
            everyday!<br>
            <br>
            When it comes down to it, I am just an East coast guy making
            my way in the big state of Texas with my family and 4 year
            old Beagle. I spend my weekends camping in my RV or getting
            outside and exploring Austin.

            Hey there! I’m Daniel — a Portlander who loves photography
            and traveling. I was born in Chernivtsi, a small and beautiful
            city in Ukraine. I’m about 25% Romanian, Ukrainian, German,
            and Jewish. We moved to Portland in 97 and have lived in
            the surrounding area ever since. I speak Romanian, Russian,
            and English (I hope that one is obvious).<br>
            <br>
            Growing up, I was fascinated with exploring new places and
            capturing my experiences. Being the youngest of 7 kids raised
            by a single mom, I was taught to cherish moments over possessions
            (read: we were poor). My joy came from the memories I made
            with friends and the interesting places we could find riding
            our bikes around. After saving some money from babysitting
            my nephews one summer, I quickly spent it on a camera that
            I used to capture everything. In school, I was the guy walking
            around with a camera while everyone else walked around texting
            bae on their flip phones. Photography was my enabler — my
            escape into a world of beauty and depth. It was, and it continues
            to be my motivation to see the world.<br>
            <br>
            I love remote places. Far away from cities with wild climates
            such as Iceland or the fjords of Norway. I hope to one day
            visit the Faroe Islands, Lofoten Islands, and Antartica.
            As much as I love traveling, the Pacific Northwest will always
            be my home. If I’m not passing time in a coffee shop, then
            you’ll likely find me on a hike, at the coast, or on the
            mountain!<br>
            <br>
            Oh, and I really love llamas.

            split my childhood between West and East coasts, I have a
            split love for both sides of the US with a special place
            in my heart for NYC, SF, and Chicago. In my youth, I spent
            much of my free time learning photography, supporting my
            business (which included helping the small town with tech
            issues + converting old slides to a DVD format). I knew I
            always wanted to work for a tech company and avidly kept
            up with current tech news + happenings at the time. Fast
            forward to now, I'm a freelance interior + architectural
            photographer and have worked at a mid-century modern furniture
            warehouse (frontend sales, rebuilt the website, maintained

            to be working with the talented team here at InVision now
            as I've been using / following the product for years! In
            my free time, I take walks around Portland with my camera,
            travel when I get the chance, engage in discussions about
            urban design, maintain a social media feed for my photography,
            and work with local real estate and architecture firms with
            photography.

            ending up in Melbourne with my wife Tauba (we met in Israel).<br>
            <br>
            I got into support as a side gig while going to college to

            I love playing team sports. I’m currently alternating between
            ultimate frisbee, soccer and basketball, but I was previously
            part of an amateur Aussie rules football team (Google the
            sport, it’s amazing!) until injuries mounted. I was also

      Joel was born and raised on a sheep farm in New Zealand. After teaching
      himself web design and development, he started gaining American clients.
      In 2014, Joel did a trial “Living in the USA” stint that turned into
      a permanent stay. He’s lived in or traveled through most of the United
      States and has settled down in Holland Michigan. His draw to Michigan
      was the beautiful water of Lake Michigan and the inland lakes of northern
      Michigan. “They remind me of my homeland”. Joel has a passion for building
      great digital products that solve real users problems. He leads the Support
      Tools team which build and manage such tools as Radar, custom Zendesk

        Aaron started his career with Zendesk in Technical Support in Madison

        His time spent in these roles and his passion to help people drove

        asked them and appreciate the puzzle solving aspect of software development.
        This led him to spend his off time studying Computer Science and

        that is Twitter. All told, life is good.

      Howdy, Y’all! I’m ecstatic about being part of the InVision team and

      decisions and deliver quality and scalable processes and product improvements.<br>
      I am currently based out of Tucson AZ, however, I was born in Mexico
      City and spent most of my life in Texas where I studied BS in Electrical
      Engineering and MS in Systems Engineering. During which time I put some
      of my skills to good use in a real-world settings by working with the
      University and local Government to extend my research outside the lab
      and hire and funded a team that successfully implemented Optimized busing
      routing for students, a University-wide Recycling system and a Bike Sharing
      system for our students at the University of Texas at El Paso. After
      that, I was scouted by one of the VPs from UTEP and was part of the first
      round of hires for a startup in Innovative transportation technology
      (Metropia). During my time at Metropia as Director of Product Ops, I
      led an undersized team to consistently outperform KPIs and played a critical
      role in scaling the startup from $500K valuation and 3 employees to a
      B round pre-money valuation of $30M and 30 employees.<br>
      On my free time, I enjoy learning and implementing new things, in particular
      software related technologies. My latest project was using Kafka to create
      a data pipeline for tweets that used some variation of the word ‘Kevin
      Durant’. I also enjoy watching films and I try to watch one or two a
      week. Lastly, I vaguely attempt to stay in shape by occasionally running
      or playing soccer. Which reminds me I am a born and raised Madridista
      (Hala Madrid!)
